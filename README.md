# 🎉 CI/CD Project 🎉

Welcome to the CI/CD Project—where code meets automation, and you get to look cool while sipping your favorite beverage (automation's on us!). This repo is your ultimate guide to getting started with Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment using the magical powers of GitHub Actions.

## 💡 What’s Inside?
This project is designed to help you understand the basics of CI/CD without melting your brain in the process. We’ve automated a few essential tasks, so you don’t have to!

- **Automated Builds**: No more manually running `npm install` or `npm test` every time you push. GitHub Actions handles it!
- **Automatic Deployment**: When you push code to the main branch, we build and deploy the app to GitHub Pages.
- **Built-in Sass**: Because who doesn’t love some extra flavor with their pipelines?

## 🚀 How to Get Started
Ready to automate your life? Follow these steps and become a CI/CD wizard:

1. Fork the repo to your own GitHub account.
2. Clone it to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cicd-actions-project.git
   cd cicd-actions-project
   ```
3. Open in your favorite code editor (aka the one that makes you feel like you’re in a hacker movie).

## 🛠️ How the Magic Works
This repo is powered by GitHub Actions. Here’s a sneak peek at what’s happening behind the scenes:

- **Trigger**: Every time you push code to the main branch, our GitHub Action fires up.
- **Install Dependencies**: The bot installs all the necessary packages (so you don’t have to).
- **Run Tests**: It checks that everything works—because broken apps are no fun.
- **Build & Deploy**: Finally, it builds the app and deploys it to GitHub Pages, so your project is always live and updated.

## 🎯 Setting Up GitHub Actions Yourself
To set up GitHub Actions, follow these steps:

1. Head over to the Actions tab in your GitHub repo.
2. Click **Set up a workflow yourself** (you'll be greeted with a YAML editor).
3. Paste in the following super-simple workflow:

   ```yaml
   name: CI/CD Pipeline 🎉

   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - main

   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
       - name: Check out code
         uses: actions/checkout@v3
         with:
           persist-credentials: false  # Fixes Git checkout issues
           fetch-depth: 0  # Fetch full history to avoid shallow clone issues

       - name: Set up Node.js
         uses: actions/setup-node@v3
         with:
           node-version: '20'  # Updated to Node.js 20 to avoid deprecation

       - name: Install dependencies
         run: npm install

       - name: Run tests
         run: npm test

       - name: Build project
         run: npm run build

       - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
         uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
         with:
           github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
           publish_dir: ./dist
   ```

4. Commit the workflow and push some code to trigger the action. Magic will happen.

## 🌐 Live Deployment
This repo is set up to automatically deploy to GitHub Pages on every push. Once your workflow runs successfully, head to **Settings > Pages** in your GitHub repo, select the `gh-pages` branch, and boom—you’re live! 🌍

## 🔧 Customize Your Workflow
Want to add more steps? Maybe you want to:

- Run linting (`npm run lint`)
- Generate documentation
- Deploy to a different cloud provider

All you need to do is update the workflow YAML file and push the changes!

## 🤯 Why CI/CD?
If you’re asking "Why should I care about CI/CD?", here’s a breakdown:

- **Consistency**: CI/CD ensures every push is tested and deployed, reducing “it works on my machine” moments.
- **Speed**: Automating testing and deployment makes your development faster and more efficient.
- **Bragging Rights**: Because saying you’ve automated your entire workflow sounds super cool.

## ⚙️ Ensure Permissions Are Set Correctly
To make sure your GitHub Actions run smoothly:

1. Go to your repository’s **Settings**.
2. Navigate to **Actions > General**.
3. Scroll down to **Workflow permissions**.
4. Ensure **Read and write permissions** is selected. This allows GitHub Actions to push commits, create pull requests, and perform other actions in your repository.

## 🏆 You Did It!
Congrats! You’ve just set up your first CI/CD pipeline. Now, every time you push to main, GitHub Actions will run your tests, build the project, and deploy it—all without you lifting a finger.
